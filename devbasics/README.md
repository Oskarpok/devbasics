# basic-development-projects
This is where you should start your open source contributions if you're an absolute beginner. You're expected to make mistakes here, raise issues and get comfortable with the process of contributing to open source projects.

THIS IS YOUR PLAYGROUND.

### TLDR:
- Learn the basics of Git and Github to understand the terms below.
- Fork this repository
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- You can ask for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ttYFsAwKhY), or on the whatsapp group, if you're stuck.
- Make improvements to the beginners projects before moving on to the intermediate ones.

### Where to start with?
- Open up a directory of your interest and see if you can understand what is it about.
- If you understand this, you're good to fix the issues it has. We have some beginner's issues listed [here](https://github.com/DCRUSTODC/basic-development-projects/labels/good%20first%20issue).
- If you don't, learn the basics of that language, and then come back to see the improvements. We have a list of resources ready for almost every domain [here](https://github.com/DCRUSTODC/.github/blob/main/resources.md).
- When you start understanding the codebase a little, jump back to the second option.

### Pull request and commit format:
The commit message you write should be in the following format:

`type of commit`: `exact commmit heading`

where the type of commit could be either of the following:
